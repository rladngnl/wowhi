DeepFilterNet  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet)  
- Lightweight deep filtering framework for real-time full-band (48kHz) speech noise suppression.  
- Supports both Rust and Python with command-line tools and LADSPA plugins for real-time microphone noise suppression.  
- Pretrained models available; works on CPU and GPU, suitable for embedded environments such as hearing aids.

Cycle-Consitency-Audio-Noise-Filter  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bboycoi/Cycle-Consitency-Audio-Noise-Filter)  
- An open-source audio filtering project applying a modified CycleGAN architecture for speech noise removal.  
- Supports frequency and waveform transformations and can learn from asymmetric datasets.  
- Simple and effective for various noise conditions, ideal for research and rapid prototyping.

HiFi-GAN  
[Hugging Face Model](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/tts_hifigan)  
- High-performance GAN vocoder model converting mel spectrograms into high-quality speech signals.  
- Offers dramatically faster inference speed compared to WaveNet, optimized for real-time speech synthesis and enhancement.  
- Uses a generator combined with multi-scale and multi-period discriminators for simultaneous model compression and speech quality.  
- Widely used for speech restoration, text-to-speech, and noise reduction enhancement applications.
